# Titanic_Survival_Prediction
Cleaned and explored the Titanic dataset for feature engineering. Used classfication models like Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Multi Layer Perceptron, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting to predict the survivors. USed various performance metrics like accuracy, precision and recall to identify the model that helps to best fit the data.
